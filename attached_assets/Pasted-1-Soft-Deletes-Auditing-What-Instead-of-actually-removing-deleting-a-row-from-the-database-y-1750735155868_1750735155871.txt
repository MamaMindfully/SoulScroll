1. Soft Deletes & Auditing
What:

Instead of actually removing (deleting) a row from the database, you mark it as deleted by setting a field like deleted_at (a timestamp of when the delete happened) or is_deleted (boolean).

Why:

Data recovery: If a user accidentally deletes something (e.g., a journal entry), you can "undelete" it.

Audit trails: For compliance, it’s often necessary to prove what happened to data over time.

Safer development: Avoids accidental hard data loss from bugs.

How:

Add to schema:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE journal_entries ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
Update queries to use:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM journal_entries WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
For auditing, also track who/when edited:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_by VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMP;
2. Multi-Tenancy or Shared Accounts
What:

This means letting a single user account be linked to a parent/group/team (e.g., a therapist can have multiple clients, or a family account manages kids).

Why:

Scalability: You can expand your product for groups, families, clinics, schools, etc.

Growth: Enables features like shared journals, parental oversight, or team analytics.

How:

Add a parent_user_id, team_id, or group_id to your users table:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS parent_user_id VARCHAR;
For journal entries, you could relate them to a team_id or allow queries like:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM journal_entries WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE parent_user_id = $1);
Access logic: parent can see all children’s data, or group admin manages sub-accounts.

3. Row-Level Security (RLS) & Field-Level Encryption
What:

Row-Level Security: A database feature where the DBMS enforces who can see/edit each row, not just each table.

Field-Level Encryption: Sensitive fields (e.g., journal text, emails) are encrypted before storing in DB and decrypted only for authorized users.

Why:

Ultimate privacy: Even if your database is leaked or someone misconfigures API access, users' private journal data stays protected.

Compliance: Meets HIPAA, GDPR, and enterprise privacy standards.

Prevents mistakes: No accidental cross-user data leakage.

How:

Enable RLS (for PostgreSQL):

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE journal_entries ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY user_access ON journal_entries
  USING (user_id = current_setting('jwt.claims.user_id')::uuid);
Field-level encryption:

In your app, encrypt with a library before insert, decrypt after select.

Example (Node.js, crypto-js):

js
Copy
Edit
import CryptoJS from "crypto-js";
const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt("my secret", process.env.FIELD_KEY).toString();
// Save encrypted to DB
// Decrypt when loading
Or use Postgres’ pgcrypto extension:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE users SET email = pgp_sym_encrypt(email, 'mySecretKey');
