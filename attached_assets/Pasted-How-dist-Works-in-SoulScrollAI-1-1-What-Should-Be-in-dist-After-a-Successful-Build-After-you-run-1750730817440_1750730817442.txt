How /dist Works in SoulScrollAI-1
1. What Should Be in /dist After a Successful Build?
After you run npm run build, /dist should look like:

css
Copy
Edit
/dist
  index.html
  assets/
    index-xxxxxx.js
    index-xxxxxx.css
    ...other bundled assets
  manifest.json
  service-worker.js
  icon-192.png
  icon-512.png
  apple-touch-icon.png
  favicon-32x32.png
  favicon-16x16.png
  ...any other static files
All assets (CSS, JS, images) referenced by your code are hashed and put in /dist/assets/.

Manifest and icons should be in the root of /dist, NOT just in assets/.

index.html at the root (used by SPA fallback).

Service Worker and manifest at root for PWA installability.

2. How the Server Uses /dist
In your server.js:

js
Copy
Edit
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
});
All static requests (/assets/..., /icon-192.png, etc) served as files.

All other routes (/, /dashboard, /journal/123) return index.html for the React SPA.

3. How to Fix if Something is Missing or Broken
If you get 404s:

Double check: Does the file exist in /dist?

If not, make sure you imported/linked it correctly in your React or HTML code.

Re-run npm run build.

If manifest.json, icons, or service-worker.js are missing:

Make sure they're referenced in /client/index.html (or imported via Vite plugin).

For custom assets, copy them into /dist post-build or use a Vite plugin like vite-plugin-static-copy.

4. Pro-tip: Ensure Static Files Always Make it to /dist
If your icons, manifest, etc., are in /client/ or /attached_assets/, and not making it to /dist on build, add this to vite.config.js:

js
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import { viteStaticCopy } from 'vite-plugin-static-copy';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...existing config
  plugins: [
    react(),
    viteStaticCopy({
      targets: [
        { src: 'attached_assets/*', dest: '.' },        // copies to dist/
        { src: 'client/manifest.json', dest: '.' },     // copies manifest
        // Add more if needed
      ]
    })
  ]
});
Install with: npm install vite-plugin-static-copy --save-dev

5. To Test Production Locally:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
npm run start
# Then visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser
Go directly to /assets/index-xxxxxx.css and /icon-192.png in your browser.

If you see the actual file (not HTML), it works!

Visit /manifest.json and /service-worker.js. Should see valid JSON and JS.

6. Never Edit /dist by Hand
Only edit source files; /dist is regenerated on every build.

If you want custom static files, add them to your source/assets and copy in the build step.
