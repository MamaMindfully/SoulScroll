import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import path from "path";
import runtimeErrorOverlay from "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    runtimeErrorOverlay(),
    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" &&
    process.env.REPL_ID !== undefined
      ? [
          await import("@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer").then((m) =>
            m.cartographer(),
          ),

      : []),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client", "src"),
      "@shared": path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "shared"),
      "@assets": path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "attached_assets"),
    },
  },
  root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client"),
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "dist/public"),
    emptyOutDir: true,
  },
  server: {
    fs: {
      strict: true,
      deny: ["**/.*"],
    },
  },
});
Observations:

root is set to client directory, not the project root.

build.outDir is set to dist/public (NOT just dist).
This means built files land in /dist/public/, but your Express server is serving from /dist—it will NOT find the built frontend!

NO base: './' is set, which is critical for Replit and many static hosts.

Key points:

export default {
  base: './',
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    emptyOutDir: true
  }
};
This is correct! If you use this config, your static files go into /dist/ and will work with your server config.

Also sets base: './' for relative asset loading (prevents blank screens and asset 404s).

Critical Issues and Recommendations
1. BUILD OUTPUT FOLDER MISMATCH
Your main Vite config outputs to /dist/public/, but your server expects /dist/.

Result: No static files found, all 404s, app doesn’t work!

2. MISSING base: './' IN MAIN VITE CONFIG
Without this, asset URLs break on Replit and most static hosts.

What To Do
Easiest Path (Recommended for Replit/most hosts):
Delete or ignore your current vite.config.ts

Rename vite.config.replit.js → vite.config.js

This config is perfect! (outputs to /dist/, uses base: './')

Rebuild frontend:

From project root:

arduino
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm run build
Confirm: /dist/ now contains your built index.html, assets, etc.

Start your backend (Express):

node server.js

Should serve static files from /dist/, /service-worker.js, /icon-*.png, and fallback on /index.html.

Other Details to Check
package.json: Ensure "type": "module" is set for ES modules

Service worker, icons: Must be present in /dist/ after build (or you will get 404s)

Frontend entry point: Must be /dist/index.html
