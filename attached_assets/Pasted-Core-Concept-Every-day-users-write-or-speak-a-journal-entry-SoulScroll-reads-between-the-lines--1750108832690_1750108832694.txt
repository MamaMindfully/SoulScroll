Core Concept:
Every day, users write (or speak) a journal entry. SoulScroll reads between the lines — detecting patterns, summarizing emotions, and gently guiding users to reflect deeper.

“You’ve been writing a lot about control and uncertainty lately. Would you like to explore that theme with a breathing exercise or story prompt?”

🪄 Features:
AI Mood Mapper: Visualizes your emotional trends using GPT’s inference

Memory Weaving: Threads past entries together to show growth, patterns, even recurring triggers

Voice Journaling: Speak your thoughts, and the app transcribes + responds with compassion

Themed Prompts: “Grief”, “Creativity”, “Relationships”, “Resilience”, etc. (daily prompt + deep dive option)

Time Capsule Mode: See “you” from a year ago

AI Reflection Letters: GPT writes a compassionate letter to you every month, summarizing your evolution

💰 Monetization Model:
