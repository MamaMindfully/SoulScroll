Edit
npm run dev
The frontend will hot-reload at the given Replit URL.

See /shared/schema.ts and drizzle.config.ts for schema details.

6. Assets & Static Files
Place images in /attached_assets

Access them via imports using @assets/ alias

7. Common Issues / FAQ
Frontend not updating? Run npm run build again, then npm run start.

Cypress not finding server? Make sure baseUrl in cypress.config.js matches Express port.

Port already in use? Change PORT in .env and cypress.config.js.

8. Deployment
On Replit, hit “Run” or use the shell for commands.

For static deploys, you can also drag/drop /dist to Netlify.

Always verify /dist has all assets and HTML after build.
